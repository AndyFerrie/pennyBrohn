        <h1>The Health & Wellbeing Wheel</h1>
        <p>
          Using the Health & Wellbeing Wheel is a great way to track how you
          currently feel. It can help you recognise what supports your energy
          and health and what drains it.
          <br /><br />
          Perhaps you&apos;ve always taken very good care of your body with
          regular exercise, but have paid less attention to your emotional
          health? Perhaps you&apos;ve never really thought about your spiritual
          health before?
          <br /><br />
          You can use this tool to help you get more support in the areas of
          your life that need it and to develop resilience. Once completed, we
          can signpost you to the services that Penny Brohn offers that may be
          helpful for you.
          <br /><br />
          As you scroll down and read the descriptions of the different areas,
          take a moment to reflect on how you currently feel and click the wheel
          on the left to choose a score between 6 = “as good as it could be” and
          0 = “as bad as it could be”.
